# Trade Flow Efficiency Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes **trade flow efficiency** by examining **supplier behavior**, **payment terms**, and **order timing patterns**. The study uncovers key insights into **trade dynamics**, **frequently traded goods**, and **seasonal or regional variations** to provide actionable insights to optimize global trade processes.

## Problem Statement
This project aims to **understand the drivers of trade flow efficiency** through the analysis of various trade components such as supplier behavior, payment terms, and order timing. This study aims to identify key trends in international trade, uncover trade flow dynamics, and assess frequently traded goods. Additionally, it highlights seasonal and regional variations to derive actionable insights for optimizing trade operations.

## Key Features
- Analysis of **supplier behavior**, **payment terms**, and **order timing**.
- Identification of **top exporting/importing countries** and **most frequently traded goods**.
- Examination of **trade balance** and **market trends** across different years and regions.
- Insights into **preferred payment terms** and **order timing patterns**.
- Use of **statistical metrics** such as mode, range, skewness, and kurtosis for trade pattern analysis.
- Use of visualisation tools to depict the insights.

## Dataset
The dataset includes records of imports and exports across various countries, detailing:
- **Quantity** of traded goods
- **Transaction Value** 
- **Customs Code**
- **Weight** of shipments
- **Payment Terms**
- **Supplier and Buyer Information**
- **Year and Month** of transactions
# Global Trade Analysis Dashboard

## **Overview**
This dashboard provides an in-depth analysis of global trade trends between 2019 and 2024, focusing on imports, exports, shipping methods, suppliers, and other essential metrics. The data is visualized through various charts, allowing for an interactive exploration of trade patterns and performance across multiple dimensions.

---

### **1. Trade Volume Analysis**
- **Total Value of Goods Exported and Imported**: The sunburst chart compares total imports and exports over the years.
  - **Insight**: The export volume has been consistently higher than the import volume, reflecting a global focus on wealth generation through exports.
  
- **Top 10 Countries with Maximum Export Sales Profits**: The treemap showcases the top 10 countries that have generated the most export sales profits.
  - **Insight**: There is no dominating country considering top 10 countries as export sales profits are not very significant for these countries.

---

### **2. Temporal Trends (Yearly/Monthly Trends)**
- **Yearly Export Volume**: The line chart shows how export volumes have evolved over time.
  - **Insight**: Export volumes peaked in 2021-2022, reflecting a strong recovery post-pandemic, whereas 2019 saw more stable growth.
  
- **Yearly Import Volume**: Visualized through a bubble chart, which represents the total import values each year.
  - **Insight**: Imports have also shown an increase, with larger volumes observed in 2021-2022, suggesting strong global demand post-pandemic.

---

### **3. Geographical Trade Patterns**
- **Top 10 Importing Countries**: The heatmap highlights the countries that spend the most on imported goods.
  - **Insight**: Although US, China, and India are major importers for many goods, we see countries like the Czech Republic and Gabon, which highlight strong domestic demand for specific products.

- **Top 10 Exporting Countries**: The choropleth map shows the countries with the highest export values.
  - **Insight**: Countries like China, Germany, and Japan, which are major exporters of many goods, do not dominate global exports, especially in electronics, vehicles, and machinery.

---

### **4. Supplier Behavior**
- **Top 10 Global Suppliers**: A scatter plot visualizes the most profitable suppliers in global trade.
  - **Insight**: Suppliers like Carter Ltd, Johnson Inc., and Clark Inc. (US) lead in export value, maintaining their dominance in the global supply chain.

---

### **5. Trade Performance (Country-Wise Evaluation)**
- **Top 5 Countries with Maximum Trade Balance**: A bar chart shows countries with the highest positive trade balance.
  - **Insight**: Countries like Gabon and the Czech Republic have a significant trade surplus, exporting far more than they import.

- **Countries with Negative Trade Balances**: Countries with higher import dependence are highlighted.
  - **Insight**: Some countries, like India, have a trade deficit, importing more goods than they export.

---

### **6. Cost and Revenue Analysis**
- **Average Trade Value per Transaction**: A gauge chart displays the average value per transaction.
  - **Insight**: Higher transaction values indicate that trade often involves bulk or high-cost goods.

- **Average Value per Unit**: The bar chart shows which products generate the most revenue per unit sold.
  - **Insight**: High-value goods such as electronics and machinery have the highest unit values, reflecting their capital-intensive nature.

---

### **7. Shipping and Logistics**
- **Shipping Method Preferences for Exports and Imports**: Donut charts show the preferred shipping methods for both exports and imports.
  - **Insight**: Sea freight is the most popular shipping method, as it offers cost-efficiency for bulk trade, while air freight is used more selectively for urgent or high-value goods.

---

### **8. Payment Term Analysis**
- **Common Payment Methods for Exports and Imports**: Pie charts show the most popular payment methods used.
  - **Insight**: Prepaid and payment on delivery are the most common terms, offering security and guarantees for international trade.
